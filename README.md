Part 2
1. the difference between regular expressions in infix notation and those in postfix notation.
2. how Thompson's construction for regular expressions works.
3. what is meant by the term irregular language in the context of regular expressions.

1.	Explain the difference between regular expressions in infix notation and those in postfix notation.

First to explain the difference between infix notation and postfix notation when it comes to regular expressions, first lets break it down we first need to understand the basics of what regular expressions are, then to build off of that we must also know what infix notation and postfix notation is as well, first is regular expressions once we know these things, we can then compare the differences between the two and come to a conclusion.

What are regular expressions? 
“A regular expression is a pattern that the regular expression engine attempts to match in input text”1.

Regular expressions are a string of characters in which the characters indicate a search function by they to find and or replace a string of characters, in computing regular expressions or mostly used by search engines, an example of these characters would be backslash (\) which is used in regular expressions to specifies the character which follows the backslash is a special character.

What are infix notation and postfix notation?
Infix and postfix are different ways of writing notations, Infix is the basic way we do maths where the operators are place in the middle of numbers/digits/characters such as 2+4*5 or 208-1/3, with infix notation parentheses are used to show order of operation for the operators, postfix on the other hand also Reverse Polish notation have it so that the operators will follow after the operands such as 24+ or 35- when it comes to multiple operators then operators are given after then second operand.

Differences between regular expressions in infix notation and those in postfix notation 
When it comes to the difference between infix notation and postfix notation both are going to be handled differently and processed differently due to infix using brackets and having its operators between the operand and postfix having it operators after its operand two different approaches are going to have to be used for each one when it comes to using them in a regular expression.
